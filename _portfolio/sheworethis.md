## what was asked?
The brief was to build an online shop as part of the companys re-brand ahead of their new launch events. The company has built a huge following on Instagram's platform, so the website needed to match this and target their customers. Also in the brief was to create promotional graphics for the launch event and on going promotions.

## What was done
After a few discussions on what was needed, what the target audience was, and what the customer felt they needed for they brand, I utilised the wordpress & woocommerce platform to build the online shop. Time was against us so we opted for a theme customisation to match the look of the website, as opposed to a custom built theme.

I added additional background features like keywords for search engines plus more (Seo), added security features to stop viruses and hacking, joining with up social media to help with promotions.

## What came out
Are you looking to launch your new website and in need of some tips to make sure its a bit.
