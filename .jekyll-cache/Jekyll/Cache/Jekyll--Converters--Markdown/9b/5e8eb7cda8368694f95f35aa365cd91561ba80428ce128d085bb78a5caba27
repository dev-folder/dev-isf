<p>If you have ever heard yourself scream â€˜I need a website!â€™ or you have been getting sleepless nights and worried about how to go about setting up an online kingdom. Well let me break it down for you, and you will be online before you know it!</p>

<h2 id="the-name">The name</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is sit down and work out what you want your website to be called. It can be anything thatâ€™s relating in what your website is about. Either your name, business name, project related, or anything.</p>

<p>Once you have a few ideas on your name, itâ€™s now time to purchase your domain. This is your unique part of the internet that will make it easy for everyone to find you. There are many variations either a .com, .net, .org etcâ€¦ to be honest it doesnâ€™t really matter. As .com used to be king for years but with so many of them already been bought, people have had to be creative in their choices.</p>

<p>Once you have found a domain name that is available to purchase, it is now time to find a domain vendor to purchase. Companyâ€™s charge different prices for the exact same product, so it might be worth doing a search to find the best price. (Anything over Â£10 for just a domain name is too much, and they are ripping you off)</p>

<p>Once you have your domain name. Itâ€™s now time to setup a place to store your website files for your domain name to display. This is called â€˜web hostingâ€™. This is separate from your domain in that you can have your hosting with the same or a separate company. Like domain vendors, their are also many companyâ€™s providing a â€˜website hostingâ€™ service, they also range in various prices.</p>

<p>Your choice of web host depends on your project. This is outlined more deeply in the following post <a href="http://andy.cymru/webb">Finding the right web host provider for you</a>

<p>Part of the design process is adding the right content for the audience your website is aimed at. Content is key, so it is important that all your text, spelling and grammar is perfect, images are correct and sized properly, your logos have been designed and applied properly, and everything has been carefully analysed to deliver the best your website can be.
