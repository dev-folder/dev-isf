<h1 id="running-a-business-with-a-disability">Running a business with a disability</h1>
<p>Throughout my life I have never saw my disability as a negative, I just sometimes have to do things differently. In business I have found having a disability can improve other skills in the work place. If you are thinking of starting a business, going freelance or looking to be the next big entrepreneur, here is a small guide to get you started.</p>

<h2 id="be-upfront-with-your-clients">Be upfront with your clients</h2>
<p>You don’t need to state your disability in your email footer or answer machine message. But if you struggle with a form of communication or access, be straight up and offer a solution that suits you. People are accommodating and often are willing to help as long as they know how they can help you.</p>

<h2 id="ability-before-disability">Ability before disability</h2>
<p>If you can do a job/project then your hired regardless of disability. These days with the internet, we can be screened through our talent and work ethic, rather than disability. I’ve had clients that didn’t know I was disabled as we communicated over email and I just concentrated on getting the job done. Don’t think you can’t bid for work because of your disability, it’s all about getting the work done that the client is bothered about.</p>

<h2 id="set-your-boundaries">Set your boundaries</h2>
<p>Make your calendar/diary work for you in order of making sure your organise your time properly. Set time for breaks or rest-bite or you can get burnt out quite quickly. Depending on disability your day can often include extra disability related tasks, So it’s important to include that around your work slots. People are hungry for your time, so make sure you get your priorities right first.</p>

<h2 id="think-outside-the-box">Think outside the box</h2>
<p>Quite often we are having to re-route and think outside the box with our natural life of living with a disability. Use this skill to your advantage and think of different ways you can find a gap in the market that’s not being done. Either a product or service that will help/aid people or a different marketing technique for promoting your business.</p>

<h2 id="get-social-and-network">Get social and network</h2>
<p>No business can sustain without some form of promotion. Social media is perfect for launching and promoting business. Also on Facebook there are many groups you can join with like-minded people, where you can share tips and get advice and guidance. It can really give your business a boost and also help you personally, as running a business on your own can get very lonely fast.</p>

<h2 id="round-up">Round-up</h2>
<p>There are more disabled entrepreneurs and freelancers than the media is allowed to show, so don’t feel alone. Enjoy it, the ups will certainly outweigh the down. Keep going, you got this!</p>
