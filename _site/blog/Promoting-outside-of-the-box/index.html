<p>Marketing and promotion has evolved over the years, as people are connecting more online, while traditional media is declining. It is important to keep on top of your marketing and work out ways to slip through the mundane and connect with your audience.</p>

<p>Your marketing strategy depends on what your project is and what it can offer, but there are a few common points that all businesses still need to follow.</p>

<p>As regular marketing streams have become very saturated, it is important to also think outside the box to target your audience.</p>

<h2 id="analyse-you-audience">Analyse you audience</h2>
<p>What is your target audience? What do they do? Where do they go? How would they pursue what you offer?</p>

<p>It’s important to find and work out as much as you can about your audience and how they tick, so you can plan how to market your project to them.</p>

<p>Once you know what your budget is, it’s time to plan which strategy will work within your budget. Regardless of marketing strategy it’s definitely wise to create social media accounts. This will help to expand your exposure. Plus social media accounts are free! Think which social media your audience will be using and setup them first, then expand and create more as your content grows.</p>

<p>It’s important to be clever with your promoting and market and try to hit as many people as possible with the least amount of time and money spent.</p>

<h2 id="clever-control">Clever Control</h2>
<p>Once you know your audience and budget you can then plan your strategy of who your going to market towards.</p>

<p>If you are a brick and mortar shop selling products why don’t you specifically put posters and ads where people need to sit and wait I.e doctors surgeries, barbers/hair dressers etc.. places where people wait and deliberately read the walls. If your an online product then think about paying to put your banner on a popular website related to your project, or get a popular website to write a review on your project. These strategy’s are common, so it’s important to be cleaver and think of something different but still related to your project.</p>
