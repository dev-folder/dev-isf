<h1 id="choosing-the-right-domain-name">Choosing the right domain name</h1>
<p>Choosing a good name for your business can come to you quite quickly or it can be one of the most challenging parts of starting a project. Added to that task, you then need to hope that the domain is available to purchase.</p>

<p>If you are like me and struggle to think of something instantly, then its worth writing a list of potential names that you like and different variations of the name. There is no exact rule on length of domain name but previous studyâ€™s say that the shorter the name, the easier it is for visitors to remember. Although these days with social media and search engines like google, website traffic comes from people clicking links rather than physically typing in web addresses. So its your option.</p>

<p>Once you have your names, its worth visiting a domain vendor and type your names into their search box and find one that is available.</p>
