<h1 id="make-your-website-accessible">Make your website accessible!</h1>
<p>Most of the internet still doesn’t have accessible websites. When I say accessible, I mean a human with a form of disability cannot use your website.</p>

<p>We are in the technical era and as we get older we will start to become impaired and naturally start to need aids to use technology, it’s natural.</p>

<p>What are you going to do when you lose your eye sight and all the websites you have visited most of your life suddenly are unable to use because a designer cannot be arsed implementing accessibility.</p>
