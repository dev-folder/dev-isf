# Make your website accessible!
Most of the internet still doesn’t have accessible websites. When I say accessible, I mean a human with a form of disability cannot use your website. 

We are in the technical era and as we get older we will start to become impaired and naturally start to need aids to use technology, it’s natural. 

What are you going to do when you lose your eye sight and all the websites you have visited most of your life suddenly are unable to use because a designer cannot be arsed implementing accessibility.
