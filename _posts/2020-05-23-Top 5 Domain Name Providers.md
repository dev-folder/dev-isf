# Top 5 Domain Name Providers
There are many domain providers and they all technically offer the same service. From my experience of using their product and service, here is my top five:-

1. Namecheap
2. TsoHost
3. 123-Reg
4. Go-daddy
5. 1and1

> When it comes to domains, all businesses are roughly the same.
