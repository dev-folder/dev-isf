# Work ethic to working smart!
I was approached recently with the question ‘with my 15 years experience of being freelance/self employed, what advice have I got for others embarking on their journey?’ And this got me thinking.

Success is a goal post thats different for everybody and each goal has a different journey to be met. But there are certain common factors that you need to follow  to create a solid base for reaching your target.

Here is my advice on important factors of what it takes to be successful in reaching your goals.

## Focus on your tasks
It’s important to setup small tasks that help you get closer to your big goal. Write them down and make sure you do the tasks within their time slot. Clear any distractions and focus to get the jobs done.

## Setup a daily routine

## Automate as much as possible
Either apps to do the heavy lifting or hire someone to help you with certain tasks.

## Persistence is key

## Network as much as possible
You need to network online via social, but also offline too.
