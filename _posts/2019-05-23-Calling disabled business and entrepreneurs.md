# Calling disabled business and entrepreneurs
Since I started working in business I have often needed to look for advice on a way of tackling a situation due to my disability. There was never a place I could go to, there were many mummy’preneur groups, LGBT groups, ethnic minority groups etc but I could never find a good one that represented me in business. Don’t get my wrong there are disability support groups, but they often tend to be political or bashing on the bad side of life.

So I decided I would setup my own project. It’s called ‘disBiz’ which is short for ‘disabled business’ and the aim is to provide informative and constructive advice for building/running a business with a disability. There are many business advice websites already, but disBiz is more aimed at business through a disabled eye. It’s a lot more focused on disability specifics. 

It is a project that I have often needed through starting and running my business. A place I can go where there are people in the same boat and have faced the same issues as me. I hope this project helps many people for the future.
