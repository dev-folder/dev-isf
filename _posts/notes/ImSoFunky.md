# Thinking Notes
Need to give Andy.Cymru a little over haul. The Site is ok, but need more content and more updates. More blog posts need to be added and published. The site needs to have things to be interested in, not just info on me, it needs to have things people desire whether its content or products or both. People don’t want to go on the site to just read about me, they need to get something out of it, whether its something they can buy or knowledge they can learn and use. The look and aesthetic is ok, but needs an overhaul and new thinking behind it.

Content I can add
	**products**
Jewellery
Designs & Artwork
Decoupage

	**Content**
Top tips on business, advertising and marketing.
Tips on fashion and wearable tech



Needs a email list and a reason for people to join to get something from.

What can I offer advice on...
Jewellery, Web design, graphic design, seo, social media, sports coaching,
