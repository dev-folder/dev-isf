Email has been the main staple of digital communication since the early days of the internet. It took off instantly and before long everyone seemed to communicate over email, especially in business. Hotmail, aol and yahoo were the main services that people used for email.

As email has evolved, in the business world many people have Hotmail, yahoo, gmail etc.. accounts. In this day these are fine for personal use, but for business it is important to use your domain email address. When you purchase a domain you will be provided with a facility to use email addresses. Whether via an inbox or forwarding to a gmail/hotmail etc account.

Using a domain email will provide a much more professional image when communicating with a client.
